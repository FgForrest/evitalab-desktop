# evitaLab Desktop developer documentation

The evitaLab Desktop is an [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) app which uses [Vue.js framework](https://vuejs.org/) for 
its views. To build the application,
we use [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) package manager. The current version of 
[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) can be found in `.nvmrc`.

For the views UI, we use the [Vuetify](https://vuetifyjs.com/en/) framework with some design customizations to speed up the UI
building process. The goal is to keep the UI stack as close as possible to the base [evitaLab](https://github.com/FgForrest/evitalab/blob/dev/documentation/developer/index.md).

_We are working on it, will be added soon._
